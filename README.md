# Project Background

The Center for Student Involvement currently lists 600+ UCSD Student Organizations on it's main site. 
While the organizations can be navigated by different categories, it is difficult for Associate Director's at the Career Center to quickly pinpoint individual student organization data and contact information on a single database. 

This webscraping project automates this extraction process to maintain an updated database of these 600+ studnet organizations as a resource for all Associate Directors and staff at the UC San Diego Career Center.
